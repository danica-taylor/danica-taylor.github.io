          All Html elements are essentially small rectangles.
          <br />
          That are made up of Three properties that control the space that
          surround the Html element.
          <br />
          The Margin, Border and Padding.
        </h2>

        <p>
          First we will look at the <strong>Padding</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Padding</strong> controls the amount of space between the
          (htmel) elements content and its <em>border</em>.
          <br />
          In the image provided you will see the <em>contents</em> nested within
          the baby green box (the <em>padding</em>).
          <br />
          If we increase the baby green box (<em>padding</em>) it will increase
          the distance between the contents and the border.
          <br />
          <br />
          The next property we will look at is the <strong>Margin</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          An elements <em>margin</em> controls the amount of space between an
          elements border and surrounding elements
          <br />
          Here we can see the baby green box nested within the dark green box (
          for this explanation lets imagine that the border section on this
          image is merely a line).
          <br />
          Now back to our example, If we were to increase the darker green box
          (margin) it will increase the distance between our border and
          surrounding elements and if we were to set our elements margin to a
          negative value, the element would grow larger.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lastly we have our <strong>border</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Our layer that sits between the <strong>Padding</strong> and our
          <strong>Margin</strong> and by default this layer doesn't have a width
          but can be changed through the css border property.
          <br />
          <br />
          So the difference between the three properies is that broken down we
          can see they all play a different role in creating or taking away
          space from the surroundings of the html content.
