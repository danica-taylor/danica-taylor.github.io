      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.

          You may hear people in the tech space call them the <strong>front-end stack</strong> or the <strong>web stack</strong> refering to the <strong>power trio</strong> of 
          <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>. Which is all dandy that is their literal roles. 
          <br>
          However what I found that stuck with me the most in the beginning and during my learning journey in web dev, was a particular analogy that describes the relationship between them all,
          that helped me really grasp how they work together.

          Meet the 
          <br>
          <strong>Three Amigos</strong>
          <br>
          Starting off with our friend
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>HTML: The Builder</strong> that defines the structure. Which is typically the content that you see on your webpage. 
          But our HTML builder on his own with his structure by default can look pretty average, pretty boring
          and that's when HTML: The builders bestest friend comes in.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>CSS: The Artist</strong> that provides the appearance and styling to our structure. Sprinkling in pizzazz to make ya eyes go oooooo. CSS can't live without html or
          else there would nothing for her to style. 
          <br>
          <br>
          For the longest time these two best-friends had everything we needed to create an awesome looking and functioning structure (remember that's the webpage). However both were quite limited
          in how much interactivity they provided. That's where our boy, the one they call him comes into play. The glue that ties <strong>HTML: The Builder</strong> and our <strong>CSS: The Artist</strong> together.

          Control FLow And Loops

      <div>
        <p>
          Control flow is all about the order in which our code is run, we're able to control the flow of our code and either execute or loop over certain sections based upon whether a given condition is true or false
