      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.

        <h2>The Power Trio</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          You may hear people in the tech space call them the <strong>front-end stack</strong> or the <strong>web stack</strong> refering to the <strong>power trio</strong> of 
          <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>. Which is all dandy that is their literal roles. 
          <br>
          However what I found that stuck with me the most in the beginning and during my learning journey in web dev, was a particular analogy that describes the relationship between them all,
          that helped me really grasp how they work together. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Meet the 
          <br>
          <strong>Three Amigos</strong>
          <br>
          Starting off with our friend
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>HTML: The Builder</strong> that defines the structure. Which is typically the content that you see on your webpage. 
          But our HTML builder on his own with his structure by default can look pretty average, pretty boring
          and that's when HTML: The builders bestest friend comes in.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>CSS: The Artist</strong> that provides the appearance and styling to our structure. Sprinkling in pizzazz to make ya eyes go oooooo. CSS can't live without html or
          else there would nothing for her to style. 
          <br>
          <br>
          For the longest time these two best-friends had everything we needed to create an awesome looking and functioning structure (remember that's the webpage). However both were quite limited
          in how much interactivity they provided. That's where our boy, the one they call him comes into play. The glue that ties <strong>HTML: The Builder</strong> and our <strong>CSS: The Artist</strong> together.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>JavaScript: The Wizard</strong> that add the sorts of interactive things to the already stylish structure (our webpage), that us the people want out of a web document these days. Making our experience online that much better and fluid.

          <h2>Control FLow & Loops</h2>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Control flow is all about the order in which our code is run, we're able to control the flow of our code and either execute or loop over certain sections based upon whether a given condition is true or false.
          <br>
          Let's have a look at a more digestible way into Control FLow. Here we have a Control Flow Chart using an example of ordering takeaways, there are two paths "Order Take-Away" or "Don't Order", the chart below will help us decide whether to order or to not.
          <br>
          <br>
          Starting off with
          <ul>
            <li>Are you hungry? Y/N</li>
                <em>Let's go N</em>
            <li>Did you eat recently? Y/N</li>
                <em>Let's go N</em>
            <li>Is it time to eat? Y/N</li>
                <em>Let's go Y</em>
            <li>Is there any food in the house? Y/N</li>
                <em>Let's go N</em>
          </ul>
          Ending up at the decision to "Order Take-away" 
          <br>
          <br>
          In summary
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Control flow is the overall path of our decision-making process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Loops allow us to repeat actions and consider multiple options before making a final choice.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Both Control Flow and Loops are fundamental to problem-solving and decision making in our daily lives, even in something as simple as deciding what to eat.

          THE DOM 
        </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. 
          The DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together.
          <br>
          API being an Application Programming Interface â€” kind of like a messenger that helps two applications to talk to each other. A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.
          <br>
          In both cases, it is the same document but the DOM (Document Object Model) representation allows it to be manipulated as an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
          <br>
          <br>
          Down below is an example of a simplified view of the hiearchical structure that our browser uses to make sense of everything going on.
