      <br />
      EQ (Emotion Quotient) refers to your emotional intelligence and social
      skills, including cognitive empathy, emotional regulation and motivation.
      Conversely, IQ measures your cognitive and intellectual skills,like
      working memory, analytical thinking and knowledge retention. IQ tests can
      give a general measure of your ability to solve problems, use of logic, and
      grasp or communicate complex ideas. Then EQ tests can give you a general
      measure of your ability to recognize emotions in yourself and others, and
      to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
