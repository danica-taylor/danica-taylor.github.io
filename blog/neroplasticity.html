            <h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
             Understanding the principles of neroplasticity benefits people by giving them that doorway and new perspective into how their brains actually process information 
             and how the brain scientificly grows. 
            <br>
             Making your brain extremely resilient and is the process by which all permanent learning takes place in your brain. Its limits are not yet known.

            <h2>How we might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for our benefit.</h2>
             Now once aware of the principles of neroplasticity we can actively engage with it by repeatedly practicing an activity or accessing a memory, 
            <br>
             where our neural networks (groups of neurons) can then fire together, creating electrochemical pathways. Shaping themselves according to that activity or memory.
            <h2>These are some ways to increase our neuroplasticity</h2>
             Practicing regularly, like the saying practice makes perfect. It may not need to reach perfection, however the amount of efforts put in during the process is what we want to focus on. 
            <br>
             Putting information into context making it relateble to already existing pathways in our brains making it more digestible for us to grasp onto. 
            <br>
             Doing it this way helps us see the relationship between the concepts. Creating more successful long time memory storage and retrival.

            <h2>- - Growth Mindset - -</h2>
            <h2>What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant.</h2>
             Growth Mindset is a different way of thinking, that anyone can develope. It is the belief that talents and skills can be devloped through hard-work and stratergies with a set intent of crafting towards being better each time.

            <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
             Not particulary... I had a stroke when I was 5. In turn through out my life I have had a big interest in the re-wiring and reframing of mindsets. 
            <br>
             I haven't heard the term Neruoplasticity however so branching off with that and refamilarizing myself with the concepts and reapplying them has been good.

            <h2>How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey.</h2>
             I will actively continue applying the growth mindset when I face set backs, down to the small setbacks. To reassure myself that I can continue to chip

            <h2>How these new understandings may shape and influence my learning plan and stratergy.</h2>
          
             These understandings will influence my learning plan by helping me shape a better structure to grasp new concepts such as regular 5min practices with a mindfulness exercise.
             <br>
             Aswell as 5mins of touching base on Html, css and JS so that I can become more familiar.
