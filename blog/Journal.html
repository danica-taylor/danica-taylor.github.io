          I think what surprised me the most was relearning things I was already quite familiar with,
          such as the rewirinfg and reframing of the brain. I don't know what to type at this point as I have lost my train of thought 
          but as I go it is coming back to me, You know what I am thinking about right now is the fact I enjoy code I just wish I knew more and like how and what to do.
          I think if I find me a method of how I can make it fun and encourage me to be more inquisitive and curious It will help me along my journey further.
