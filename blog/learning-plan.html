        <h2>Reassessment of my Learning Plan</h2>
  
        The pressures and challenges of Bootcamp are different from those in Foundations and the type of help and support available to me.
        <br>
        Below I have revisited similar questions to those that I answered initially when first formulating this Learning Plan (At the bottom under Foundations Learning Plan), 
        <br>
        but now with a particular focus on learning goals and objectives while on Bootcamp.

        <strong class="strong">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        My long term goal/ career pathway would be something to do with I assume the front end such as webpage design, user interface and navigation as like I have mentioned before. 
        <br>
        I enjoy the organization of how things are laid out and navigation on websites aswell as apps and also being mobile responsive. What title that actually comes under however I am still unsure of aside from UX/UI Desgin.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would like to research more on the pathways that Javascript has as I have heard through the grapevine (the google grapevine) that JS roles are more sort after in terms of pay and skill level. 
        <br>
        So I would consider such a direction with this also.
        <br>
        <br>
        The impact I would like to make once leaving dev academy would be to have confidnece in my self to go in more on personal projects, whether its alone or partnered with other 
        innovators to add towards a refined profile and protfolio, building 
        and soliderfiying my knowledge in coding/programming, alongside continuing to develop my networking and collaboration skills. 
        I think in all that however I would like to craft myself a portfolio so that it can add that spice for when applying for remote work (during this initial next phase after dev academy).
        <br>
        If possible in the sectors I mentioned above. Front end Web dev, UX/UI Design, JS pathway (if possible remote work or locally).
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong class="strong">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        After re-evaluating my stengths and limitations from my foundations section below I believe a few things have changed over my foundations time.
        <br>
        For instance my strengths have expanded over that time. A revealed strength being my dilligence and persistence to do my best with my work and ontaking each concept. 
        <br>
        Another being my ability to talk things over, not just when asking for help with peers of facilitators on my own issues and blocks I've run into, 
        but in conversation being about to talk and reflect over concepts, new materail presented 
        so that it is not only understandable for myself but everyone in the discussion.
        <br>
        <br>
        My limitations are for the most part still the same however I think my perspective was off the last time I addressed it (below in my foundations learnin plan). 
        Reason why I say that is because yes my time management and life balance is my concern but it is more 
        because of my own lack of proper preparation so that I can actively balance those things out. Theres a saying somewhere on google and out in the world somewhere that says
        <br>
        <em class="strong colourText">"We can value self-discipline, but creating systems that make it next to impossible to misbehave is mopre reliable than self-control</em> 
        <br>
        and with that in mind I think my limitation/belief can be overcame 
        with the proper methods to manage it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I think during bootcamp my strengths wll help coincide when the group projects and pairing, giving the space within the team to go back and fourth in discussion to understand how we can as a group achieve our tasks. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My limitations if not properly addressed might remain a hinderance for myself as I will feel unorganized and lag behind. (NOT WHAT I WANT)
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong class="strong">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Ahhh well I would say my limitation on myself with my time management, which could have the potential for me to fall behind.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong class="strong">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Oooooo Organization, preparation and time management.Aswell as memory retention. I aslo would like to develope my public speaking, 
        as I can converse confidently 1:1 and within small groups 2 or 3, but developing that for larger groups
        would be awesome. As despite having awareness of others in conversation I do find it overwhelming being able to sense that in a large group. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong class="strong">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        My expectations from the bootcamp team would be clear communication on what they expect from me. Approachable mannerism so that I feel safe to look stupid 
        and ask the silly questions that may be my first time encountering. But aside from that the same as expectations I listed below with during the foundations period.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong class="strong">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        My expectations on myself would be to work within my time blocks accordingly and be properly prepared before hand for each week. Such as a brief overview of what will be expected of me for that coming week 
        and how each day and time block will look in accordance to what I need to achieve. Then when working thorugh the units reaching out in discord or problem solving in a timely manner to resolve the block I am facing at the time
        <br>
        <h2 class="strong, colourText">- - Commitment to myself - -</h2>

        This is a lovely way to wrap up this exercise as I will go briefly into my plan when approaching this next part of the web dev studies here with Dev Academy. 
        <br>
        I plan to manage my workload by breaking it into smaller sections just like we would in coding/programming so that I can knuckle through it piece by piece. 
        <br>
        In regards to managing myself while working alongside others and productively I think my approach here will be pulling in from what a friend told me the other week & they said to learn to love the problems.
        Why I bring that up is because from what I know coding is all about the problems, there is no avoiding it so to fall inlove with the problems will help me in terms of the energy brought within the team, facilitators and
        peers, my approach will be less driven by fear and panic but more driven by excitement to resolve the issue.

    <h2>- - FOUNDATIONS LEARNING PLAN - -</h2>
    <p class="strong">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
    <p>
      To have a high valued skilled career in the Tech Industry. I am drawn
      towards front-end development as I like to make things pretty but also
      have come across many webpages where I just wish the site was more user
      friendly and easier to navigate aswell as responsive across multiple
      devices. I won't name names but its 2024 and as a Mother and young woman
      who is on the go I like having things online accessible within my phone.
    </p>
    <p class="strong">
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my strengths would be being able to speak up and discuss with
      facilitoators and peers when I have encountered an issue or problem I am
      unsure have to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my limitations would be my time management when it comes to
      learning. In regards to going outside of the timebox suggested, or getting
      lost on things that at this stage are not needed for the tasks given. But
      my biggest limitation would be my personal belief of balance between study
      and being Mum.
    </p>
    <p class="strong">
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>
    <p>
      My Discipline, consistencey and as well my time management (organization).
    </p>
    <p>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</p>
    <p>My commitment to managing my workload will be:</p>
    <p>To have my set study block hours and stick to them!</p>
    <p>
      To have a set 10min recap &5min goal setting in the morning before diving
      into study for the day
    </p>
    <p>
      To have a set 10min reflect at the end of my study block to see my
      progress and if I met targets.
    </p>
    <p class="strong">
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    </p>
    <p>
      Message my facilitator, Take a break and step back from the screen and
      re-evaluate where to put my time and energy and reflect on my current
      methods of managing my worktime as it may need a few adjustments to help
      me stay ontop of things better.
    </p>
    <p class="strong">
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I will seek first via help-desk on discord or during the available
      times reach out to my facilitators.
    </p>
    <p class="strong">
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect a chance to connect, learn and grow from those who I aspire to
      one day be alongside in the industry with
    </p>
    <p class="strong">
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Block out times for my personal family duties would be 7am-9am,
      1:45pm-7.30pm as between those hours I am tending to my family, from
      getting them ready, feed, quality core memory time with them, the shabang
      during those hours.
