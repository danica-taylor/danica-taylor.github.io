    <p class="strong">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
    <p>
      To have a high valued skilled career in the Tech Industry. I am drawn
      towards front-end development as I like to make things pretty but also
      have come across many webpages where I just wish the site was more user
      friendly and easier to navigate aswell as responsive across multiple
      devices. I won't name names but its 2024 and as a Mother and young woman
      who is on the go I like having things online accessible within my phone.

      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my strengths would be being able to speak up and discuss with
      facilitoators and peers when I have encountered an issue or problem I am
      unsure have to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my limitations would be my time management when it comes to
      learning. In regards to going outside of the timebox suggested, or getting
      lost on things that at this stage are not needed for the tasks given. But
      my biggest limitation would be my personal belief of balance between study
      and being Mum.
