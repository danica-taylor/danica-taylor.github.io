    What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    <br />
    To have a high valued skilled career in the Tech Industry. I am drawn
    towards front-end development as I like to make things pretty but also have
    come across many webpages where I just wish the site was more user friendly
    and easier to navigate aswell as responsive across multiple devices. I won't
    name names but its 2024 and as a Mother and young woman who is on the go I
    like having things online accessible within my phone.
    <br />
    <br />
    A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    <br />
    Some of my strengths would be being able to speak up and discuss with
    facilitoators and peers when I have encountered an issue or problem I am
    unsure have to solve.
    <br />
    Some of my limitations would be my time management when it comes to
    learning. In regards to going outside of the timebox suggested, or getting
    lost on things that at this stage are not needed for the tasks given. But my
    biggest limitation would be my personal belief of balance between study and
    being Mum.
    <br />

    Message my facilitator, Take a break and step back from the screen and
    re-evaluate where to put my time and energy and reflect on my current
    methods of managing my worktime as it may need a few adjustments to help me
    stay ontop of things better.
    <br />

    times reach out to my facilitators.

    other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school
    drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

    them ready, feed, quality core memory time with them, the shabang during
