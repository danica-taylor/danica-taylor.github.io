      <h2>A story about a time...</h2>
      <strong>I was blocked on a simple problem.</strong>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>
          Was when I was working on a small piece of code for one of my assignmets and it kept coming back with an error message
          telling me that the code wasn't working.
          <br>
          I read over the error message to see where I went wrong however it only said undefined and
          didn't really give me any details on what I had done wrong in my code.
          <br>         
          I then checked over my code again just to make sure what I had written made sense and was correct, however this time I spoke it out loud, which in 
          the techy space we call it the ("rubber duckie method"). 
          <br>         
          Using this particular method of problem-solving helped me see that I had a simple spelling error in my code. 
          <br>         
          I felt more collected, calm and in control of my thinking space when I spoke out lolud and being able to keep my train of thought.
          <br>         
          I learned that speaking out loud is a good tool to use when checking over things if unsure.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>I elegantly solved a problem</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
          When I needed help with the superFLipflop exercise. I had initially tried to use online resources such as Stack Overflow to do my own dive into what I need to use to get the results I was wanting. 
          However after so much time already spent on the exercies I decided to ask for help from a more experienced coder and they sat with me and explained the process and what it would look like. 
          <br>
          It felt good to have a in real time explanation both looking at the material at the same time, having the opportunity to bounce ideas back fourth.
          <br>
          I learned in that process that there are a variety of ways to code something that outputs the same thing. Such as doing the underlayers of code blocks and then a more faster and efficient way to write codeblocks 
          (best way I could describe it would be writing out a condensed version, utilizing multiple types of syntax for smaller, easier to code out work)

        <strong>Reflections on how confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</strong>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pseudocode:</strong>I feel somewhat confident, reason being only somewhat is because 
              I am still familiriziing myself with the syntax and names of things so pseudocoding what each particular part is doing and there for I can run into difficulties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trying something:</strong> Most part confident. Always down to try anything, or something to see the results or more error messages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong>Mostly confident. Love this method, I mentioned this one above about how it felt grounding and calming for me when my train of thought had something externally to follow along with. e.g 
              my own voice speaking things out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> Somewhat confident, not much to say on this error as from what I've experienced so far is that error messages can output such a variety of error messages, some have been easy to understand even to the point of showing with line of code needs to be changed
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong>Not too confident as I feel I am still in the works of building a decent rapor between most of them. Also groups do at times make me nervous.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong>Confident when I am able to approach in private and have a 1 on 1. Do still try my best when throwing the questions into the helpdesk to have the confidence to see it through.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> Not so confident as I feel a reflection is more something you do after working it out first or a tehniques that has some type of delay in comparison to the rest above.
              And with my not the best memory with things that are brand new. this option is already quite offputing.
            </li>

        <p>
          <strong>A time I was reluctant to ask for help and what had made me reluctant to do so. I might try differently next time?</strong>
          <br>
          <br>

        I believe an example was just recently, as of yesterday. I was reluctant to ask for help in the discord desk-help due to the fact I was asking a question in relation to the last sprint. 
        <br>
        Which made me feel like it showed a major incompedence difference in comparison due to it being such an irrelevant question to where I felt the majority would be.
        <br>
        Try just having more confidence in myself and not being fearful of sticking out between my peers. We're all here to learn.
