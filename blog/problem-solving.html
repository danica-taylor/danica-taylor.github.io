      <h2>A story about a time...</h2>
      <strong>I was blocked on a simple problem.</strong>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>
          Was when I was working on a small piece of code for one of my assignmets and it kept coming back with an error message
          telling me that the code wasn't working.
          <br>
          I read over the error message to see where I went wrong however it only said undefined and
          didn't really give me any details on what I had done wrong in my code.
          <br>         
          I then checked over my code again just to make sure what I had written made sense and was correct, however this time I spoke it out loud, which in 
          the techy space we call it the ("rubber duckie method"). 
          <br>         
          Using this particular method of problem-solving helped me see that I had a simple spelling error in my code. 
          <br>         
          I felt more collected, calm and in control of my thinking space when I spoke out lolud and being able to keep my train of thought.
          <br>         
          I learned that speaking out loud is a good tool to use when checking over things if unsure.

        2. elegantly solved a problem.

        what was the problem?
        what problem-solving techniques did you use?
        how did you feel throughout the process?
        what did you learn?
        3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:

        Pseudocode
        Trying something
        Rubber ducky method
        Reading error messages
        Console.logging
        Googling
        Asking your peers for help
        Asking coaches for help
        Improving your process with reflection
        4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
