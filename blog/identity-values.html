    <h1>Identity Values</h1>
  </header>
  <body>
    Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you
    weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and
    how you reflect on the decision now.
    <br />

    Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
    values and identity.
    <br />
    I would say alot of my surroundings and environments/cultures has been
    shakey. I will say however despite all of that they have influenced my
    values and identity of what I know I don't want to aspire too and that I
    want to carve my way out in a completely different direction. One that is a
    healed version of myself, One that stands strong in discernment but with an
    open heart and one that wants to experience the wonders of life and the
    world and not be restricted.
    <br />
    Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
    journey.
    <br />
    My strengths of determination, strong-willed or is it strong-headed. When I
    have and keep that reminder of my end goal at focus I will stay determined.
    <br />
    Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
    How might these affect your learning journey?
    <br />
    From what I have noticed I need to digest the infomation in more than just 1
    way to really grasp it. At times leading me astray. Possibly spending my
    energy where it isnt needed, but the first step is always awareness so I'm
    cautious thats the current limitation and managing that.
    <br />
    Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
    but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
    time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies
    you would try now and why.
    <br />
    I don't believe I have experienced tension when working productively,
    perhaps slight poor time management on others behalf as well leading to lack
    of motivation and pressure to have it done (wait this feels familiar).
    However a few group brainstorms of the overall blog structure, who was doing
    what, and the topic and theme of the blog it was allgoods. I did have to
    step in and assist at times, respark and maintain the morale.
    <br />
    I think since starting at the Dev Academy I have learn't that it wasn't just
    a spark of morale I had instilled in me it was the belief of "not yet" or a
    it's only a matter of time.
