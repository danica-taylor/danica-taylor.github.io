            <li><strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>My familiarity towards the Human Skills sector</li>
            <li>I find changing my decisions and choices difficult so that I am able to implement new ways of thinking</li>
            <li>I have a very harsh manner towards myself at times, that is in need of reeling in and rewiring so that I am not only kind to myself but also give myself the space to grow and learningand ultimatgely try</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>The role of those things listed above from my perspective, would be to be conscious of our own actions, decisions and movements when progressing through learning as a whole, 
            but also help add the necessary mindframe to tackle things that can be mentally strainning within the tech space and programming. </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>Being able to have other like minded people learn about the subject and be able to share and discuss it with eachother, out of all places I never understood how much Human SKills and Programming went hand in hand.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>I believe it helps train our minds to approach programming in a particular way, (from what I am feeling, A way that has worked time and time again.) A way that is a growth mindsert with no set expectatiomns or limitations on ourseleves so that w2e lean into the not yet and learning side of things. 
              I also have heard quite a few times how much these skills are not only for ourselves but are very adapatable in the workspace, between teams and groups, which is what alot of tech spaces are eager to onboard. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong> Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li>Hmmm, interesting question. It doesnt feel like a waste of time, Would love to see more practical methods to implement in relation to code though. For example Yes the learning plan, the time taking and breaks away however what action can be done in terms of practice with the actual code .</li>
